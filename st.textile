<p><b>Have you been looking to take advantage of the promise of the cloud only to discover that migrating your app to the cloud is a complex mess?</b></p>

h2. No more! We invite you to Take the Cloudify Challenge! 

<p>Cloudify enables you to take any app – no matter what its stack to the cloud of your choice – with ZERO code changes.</p>

<p>Sound too good to be true? Then by all means, come out and see it in action.</p>

<p>Join us at the IGT Cloud Summit Israel - A DLD Event, and enter your application in the Cloudify challenge.</p>

<p>One application will be selected at random by a panel of judges, combined with your votes, to be demoed live at the event.</p>

<p><b>If we lose – you win! We’ll give you a prize! If we win – you win! So what do you have to lose?</b></p>

<p>All you need to do is visit this <a href="https://cloudifysource.zendesk.com/forums/21371548-take-the-cloudify-challenge-application-submissions">CloudifySource Forum</a> to submit your application - and make sure it's <b><i>voted up</b></i>.</p>

<p>The app that has the most votes, and is qualified by our estemeed panel of judges, will be the app selected to be demoed at the event.<p>

<p><b>So what do you have to lose?</b></p>
