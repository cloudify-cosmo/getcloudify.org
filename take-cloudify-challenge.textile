<p><b>Have you been looking to take advantage of the promise of the cloud only to discover that migrating your app to the cloud is a complex mess?</b></p>

h2. No more! We invite you to <i>Take the Cloudify Challenge</i>! 

<h2><span style="color:#FF3A6B;">Deadline for submissions: November 20, 2012, 12:00 PM EST.</span></h2>

<p>Cloudify enables you to take any app – no matter what its stack to the cloud of your choice – with ZERO code changes. Now imagine Cloudify partnered with a whole new class of carrier cloud.  The <a href="http://www.alcatel-lucent.com/new-thinking/market-growth/cloud.html">Alcatel-Lucent CloudBand portfolio</a> enables service providers to configure data centers, control network resources, and quickly launch new services and applications.  With CloudBand leveraging Cloudify's technology - you can unleash the full potential of the cloud to propel innovation, secure mission-critical assets, and transform business models.</p>
<br>
<p>Sound too good to be true? Then by all means, come out and see it in action.</p>
<br>
<p>Join GigaSpaces and Alcatel-Lucent at the IGTCloud Summit Israel - A DLD Event, who are jointly sponsoring this competition, and enter your application in the Cloudify challenge.</p>
<br>

<br>
 <p> One lucky company and submitter will be eligible to win these aweseome prizes**:</b></p>

<br>
And the best part - anyone who enters will get their choice of a giveaway.
