Cloudify's Command-Line Interface is the default method for interacting with Cloudify and managing your applications. It features actions such as [uploading blueprints](getting-started-upload-blueprint.html) and [deleting them](getting-started-delete-blueprint.html), [creating deployments](getting-started-create-deployment.html), [executing workflows](getting-started-execute-workflow.html) and retrieving events (covered in the [CLI reference](cli-cfy-reference.html)).

The interface can be accessed by running the `cfy` command. `cfy -h` will get you started.

A full `cfy` commands reference can be found [here](cli-cfy-reference.html).

Note that some features, such as viewing metric graphs and application topologies are only available via the Web UI.
