This topic describes how to bootstrap and use the REST API when you don't need/want to use the Cloudify shell.

h2. Bootstrapping and the REST API

For every command that the Cloudify shell receives, it invokes a corresponding REST API command.
Users can use Cloudify's REST API in order do install/uninstall and practically everything that can be perfomed via the Cloudify shell.
 
bootstrap with I 

on the remote machine : mkdir -p ~/gs-files
copy all the files from : d:\docs\create-bootstrap-machine to ~/gs-files
put it on github and add gists ...
chmod +x ~/gs-files/*.sh 
invoke : ./my-bootstrap-management.sh false

Can b done with scp


In /home/ec2-user/gs-files : 
my-bootstrap-management.sh
bootstrap-management.sh
ec2-cloud.groovy  
ec2-cloud.properties
upload folder
 pem file

 cloudify-overrides folder



You need to create a folder gs-files under the home folder folder of the ssh user.

The REST API can be used only after there is at least one management machine alive.
In order to create management machine/s , users need to run a script similar to the one shown here : 
....
....

two machines...
...
 
The script needs to be copied to the machine and then invoked, either by using the rsh command or after accessing the machine and invoking it locally.
After the script runs successfully, the machine becomes a Cloudify managment machine.
