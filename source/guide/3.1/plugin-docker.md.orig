## An example node specification

{% highlight yaml %}

  my_nginx:
    type: cloudify.docker.Container
    properties:
      name: nginx
      image:
        repository: nginx
        tag: 1.7.9
      ports:
        8080:80
      params:
        stdin_open: true
        tty: true
        command: some-content-nginx
        environment:
          ENV_VAR: some-var-value
          ENV_VAR2: another-var-value
        volumes_from:
          boring_babbage
          sleepy_brattain
    relationships:
      - type: cloudify.relationships.contained_in
        target: some_vm

{% endhighlight %}

## Container Properties

The container node type allows you to describe the properties and lifecycle operations of a Docker container.

The properties are: name, image, ports, and params.

### name:

The `name` property is the name of the container. If this is a new container, name it anything you like. If it is an external container, give it the existing name.

For example:

{% highlight yaml %}

  existing_container:
    type: cloudify.docker.Container
    properties:
      name: boring_babbage
      use_external_resource: true

{% endhighlight %}

### image:

The `image` property is a dictionary. It must have the `repository` key or the `src` key, or both. It may additionally have the `tag` key.

The `src` key is used when you want to import an image. It must point to a file or URL where there is a tarball, which Docker can use to import an image. For more information on importing images, see [docker import command.](https://docs.docker.com/reference/commandline/cli/#import)

If you pull an image from a Docker hub, `repository` is required. If you are importing an image, you leave it blank. The plugin will name the 
repository by the Cloudify [instance ID.](http://getcloudify.org/guide/3.1/reference-terminology.html#node-instance)

The `tag` key is also optional. If you want to specify a version of a repository, you can put that in the tag.

Here is an example of importing from an URL.

{% highlight yaml %}

  cloudify_manager:
    type: cloudify.docker.Container
    properties:
      name: cloudify-manager
      image:
        src: http://gigaspaces-repository-eu.s3.amazonaws.com/org/cloudify3/3.1.0/ga-RELEASE/cloudify-docker_3.1.0-ga-b85.tar
        repository: cloudify-manager-packages
        tag: 3.1.0

{% endhighlight %}


### ports:

Use `ports` to control the port mappings of the container.

{% highlight yaml %}

  web_application:
    type: cloudify.docker.Container
    properties:
      name: web-app
      image:
        src: local-file.tar
        repository: my-application-container
      ports:
        22: 22
        80: 80
        3306, 127.0.0.1: 3306, 10.79.46.23

{% endhighlight %}


### params:

Additional parameters are allowed in the `params` dictionary. For example, the options for `std_open`, `tty`, and `environment` variables.

{% highlight yaml %}

  nodecellar_container:
    type: cloudify.docker.Container
    properties:
      name: nodecellar
      image:
        repository: uric/nodecellar
      ports:
        8080: 8080
      params:
        stdin_open: true
        tty: true
        command: nodejs server.js
        environment:
          NODECELLAR_PORT: 8080
          MONGO_PORT: 27017

{% endhighlight %}

Many of the options exposed in the Docker-Py Python Docker API are available through the Cloudify Docker Plugin. That documentation can suppliment this feature:
[docker python client.](https://github.com/docker/docker-py)

If there is a lack of description of certain parameters,
more details can be found in
[docker command line documentation.](https://docs.docker.com/reference/commandline/cli/)


## Using the plugin

The plugin is designed to follow the Docker Py Docker Python API library and not the Docker CLI. And so, it also differs from the Docker CLI in some respects. For example, `docker run` is split into `create` and `start`.

Here are the operations that this plugin currently supports:

### Create task

* Creates a container that can be started.

* Here, the plugin pulls images from the Docker Hub Registry, a private registry, or it may import an image from a tarball.

* In the blueprint, you pass ports as a dictionary. The key of each dictionary is a port that you will open on this container.
  * In the create operation, only Docker Py only needs to know the keys of the dict.
  * In the start operation, the entire dict is passed as the port_binding parameter.

* This operations adds the container_id to the instance runtime_properties.


### Start task

* This starts the container.

* It also logs containers' network settings with IPs, ports, and top information.


### Stop task

* Stops the container.


### Delete task

* Deletes the container and its runtime_properties.

# Nodecellar Example

Nodecellar is a nodejs frontend that uses a mongo database as its backend. In this example each software component of the application is run inside of its own Docker contianer.

Lets start out by installing Cloudify on your local machine. You can install Cloudify on Windows, Mac, or Linux. Visit the instructions [here.](http://getcloudify.org/guide/{{page.cloudify_version}}/installation-cli.html) In these instructions, we just install from pip:

`pip install cloudify`

Now we need to pull the git repository:

`git clone git@github.com:cloudify-cosmo/cloudify-nodecellar-docker-example.git`

Next checkout the correct version:

`cd cloudify-nodecellar-docker-example`

`git checkout {{page.cloudify_version}}`

The blueprint for the example is in the blueprint directory: docker-singlehost-blueprint.yaml. There is also an Openstack example for you to try there as well.

First notice the files that we import:

{% highlight yaml %}

imports:
  - http://www.getcloudify.org/spec/cloudify/{{page.cloudify_version}}/types.yaml
  - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cloudify-cosmo/cloudify-docker-plugin/{{page.plugin_version}}/plugin.yaml

{% endhighlight %}


The nodes in the blueprint derive their base properties from these two files. They should match in the minor version. (3.1 and 1.1, or 3.0 and 1.0.)

Notice the first node_template: host. This describes the host machine that the Docker containers will run on. In this case it will be your local computer. However, this could be adjusted to be a vagrant box or something else. 

If you decide to run the containers somewhere else, you will need to adjust the values in the inputs section or use an external inputs file.

{% highlight yaml %}

  host:
    type: cloudify.nodes.Compute
    properties:
      install_agent: { get_input: install_agent }
      ip: { get_input: host_ip }
      cloudify_agent:
        user: { get_input: agent_user }
        key: { get_input: agent_private_key_path }

{% endhighlight %}


Now let's look at the Nodecellar Container.

In this example, we are going to have a container that runs the nodejs nodecellar application. The Docker plugin will pull the uric/nodecellar container from Docker Hub.

{% highlight yaml %}

  nodecellar_container:
    type: cloudify.docker.Container
    properties:
      name: nodecellar
      image:
        repository: uric/nodecellar
      ports:
        8080: 8080
      params:
        stdin_open: true
        tty: true
        command: nodejs server.js
        environment:
          NODECELLAR_PORT: 8080
          MONGO_PORT: 27017

{% endhighlight %}


The plugin configures the container to expose port 8080, with a pseudo TTY, and two environment variables NODECELLAR_PORT, and MONGO_PORT.

Notice that port 8080 is mapped to port 8080. You could change this to map port 80 to 8080 or any other combination.


Next is the MongoDB container. The plugin will pull the dockerfile/mongodb image from Dockerhub, and create a container that exposes ports 27017 and 28017.

{% highlight yaml %}

  mongod_container:
    type: cloudify.docker.Container
    properties:
      name: mongod
      image:
        repository: dockerfile/mongodb
      ports:
        27017: 27017
        28017: 28017
      params:
        stdin_open: true
        tty: true
        command: mongod --rest --httpinterface --smallfiles

{% endhighlight %}


The plugin then starts the container with a pseudo TTY and runs the command `mondod --rest --httpinterface --smallfiles`. Again the ports 27017 and 28017 are mapped to themselves, but you could change them to different mappings if you configured MongoDB to other ports.

This is a really straight-forward example that shows you some of what you can do with this plugin. 

Now, let's get Cloudify setup so you can run the plugin.

Start by installing the plugins that the blueprint needs:

`cfy local install-plugins -p docker-singlehost-blueprint.yaml`

Next, we will initialize the environment:

`cfy init -p docker-singlehost-blueprint.yaml`

Now you are ready to run the blueprint:

`cfy local execute -w install`

This might take a while to execute. It needs to install download the Docker images and then it will create the containers.

When it is finished, you can open a browser to 127.0.0.1 and you will see the Nodecellar application.

{% tip title=Using boot2docker %}
If you are using Mac OSX, you might be using boot2docker instead of the regular Docker daemon. If that is the case, you might need to make some changes to the above process.

First of all, the URL will not be 127.0.0.1 as for the Linux example. It will likely be be 192.168.59.103. (However, even this can change.)

Now also once you install the plugin locally, you need to change the client file. Find the docker_client.py file in your python library. Add the following:

    from docker.utils import kwargs_from_env

    kwargs = kwargs_from_env()
    kwargs['tls'].assert_hostname = False

And the change this line:

        return docker.Client(**daemon_client)

To:

        return docker.Client(**kwargs)

{% endtip %}
