h1. *Cloudify Roadmap*

<p>Below you will find our roadmap for new features and improvements to Cloudify, including notes on those currently being worked on.</p>

<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-warning"><strong>Note</strong><br>
    Cloudify aims for a minor release every 4-6 months with new features, bug fixes, security enhancements, and more. A service release with bug and security fixes is also intended for delivery every 1-2 months. The next release is Cloudify 4.0, expected in March 2017. Items that are marked as <strong>In Progress - 4.0</strong> below are included in this release. 
</div>

<h2>Cloudify Manager </h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>High Availability</strong>: HA setup will ensure the uptime of Cloudify Manager in production environments. <strong>IN-PROGRESS - 4.0</strong></li>
<li><strong>Multi-tenancy</strong>: The ability to set tenants (user groups) with a Cloudify Manager and isolate resources among them, such that one tenant does not have visibility of, nor the ability to access, data/resources of another. <strong>IN-PROGRESS - 4.0</strong></li>
<li><strong>Pre-bootstrap Verification</strong>: As part of the bootstrap process, Cloudify automatically verifies as many variables as possible before actually initiating the bootstrap process. Specifically &ndash; IaaS API credentials and quotas, validity of specified parameters such as image ID, etc in order to ensure successful bootstrap of Cloudify Manager. <strong>IN-PROGRESS</strong></li>
<li><strong>Encrypted Data Store</strong>: Encrypted key/value store for storing application-sensitive data such as cloud credentials, secrets and configuration parameters, which users can then access via blueprints. <strong>IN-PROGRESS</strong></li>
<li><strong>Manager Settings Configuration</strong>: Allows users to easily modify and apply manager configuration elements to Cloudify Manager, during runtime, via dedicated CLI commands and GUI elements. <strong>IN-PROGRESS - 4.0</strong></li>
<li><strong>Encrypted Communication</strong>: Agents communicate with the manager via an encrypted channel (SSL). IN-PROGRESS</li>
<li><strong>RBAC</strong>: Allow setting permissions to resources based on users roles, and by that providing a fine-grained access control. Also, with the permissions mechanism the owners of a resource will be able to give specific permissions to specific users in the tenant.) - IN-PROGRESS</li>
</ul>
<h2>Core Orchestration, DSL, and App Modeling</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>OASIS TOSCA Simple Profile YAML 1.0</strong>: Introduce support for modeling applications and VNFs using standard OASIS TOSCA Simple Profile 1.0 YAML DSL. <strong>IN PROGRESS</strong></li>
<li><strong>ARIA Integration</strong>: Utilizing the <a href="http://ariatosca.org/">ARIA TOSCA</a> Orchestration Library for all orchestration and workflow capabilities.<strong> IN-PROGRESS</strong></li>
<li><strong>Service Composition</strong>: Consume existing, running deployed services with new application blueprints for service composition and building microservices architecture.</li>
<li><strong>Application Blueprint Versioning</strong>: The ability to upload new versions of application blueprints, and apply them selectively to running deployments.</li>
<li><strong>Resuming Failed Workflows</strong>: Built-in ability for Cloudify Manager to resume from the last successful execution point. This is useful when the workflow fails due to infrastructure allocation error, quotas, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Scheduled Workflow Execution</strong>: The ability to schedule a workflow execution at a future time, such as scaling the number of web server VMs at a certain time of the day.</li>
<li><strong><strong>Improved Multi-cloud Support</strong>: Better support for multi and hybrid cloud environments.</strong></li>
