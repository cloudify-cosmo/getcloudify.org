<p>Cloudify 3.0 is a major milestone for Gigaspaces. It tightens our integration with Openstack and steers the product architecture to closely match the OpenStack architecture stack. There are several ways to get started with Cloudify 3.0 on OpenStack:</p>

<ul>
<li>You can use an OpenStack public cloud such as HP Cloud</li>
<li>You can use your own OpenStack private cloud</li>
<li>There is also an option to download a Vagrant box that will let you bootstrap Cloudify inside a single VM.</li>
<li>Finally, there is an option to run Devstack and use it as your own private cloud for bootstrapping Cloudify 3.0.</li>
</ul>

 <p>Setting up and running Devstack is pretty straight forward and you can use the  <a href="http://devstack.org/" target="_blank">official quick guide</a> as your reference.</p>

<p>You need to ensure that the computer running Devstack has enough resources for the Devstack + 3 additional VMs running inside it (16GB RAM is highly recommended, but 8 GB should work too).</p>

<p>Add an Ubuntu image (12.04 LTS is recommended) from the <a href="http://cloud-images.ubuntu.com/precise/current/precise-server-cloudimg-amd64-disk1.img" target="_blank">Ubuntu official cloud images</a> to your new DevStack environment. Once Devstack is installed, I recommend signing into its web UI and spawning a small Ubuntu instance as a validation that the installation was indeed successful.</p>

<p>Next, go to the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/downloads/get_cloudify.html">Cloudify download page,</a> and choose the relevant Debian package (either 32 or 64 bit). Install the package: <code>dpkg –I ./ cloudify-cli_3.0.0-ga-b6_amd64.deb </code> Then we will need to configure Cloudify to use its Openstack plugin for bootstrapping. It is recommended to do it in a dedicated folder: <code>mkdir cloudify_work</code> cd Cloudify_work cfy init openstack Follow the steps in the Cloudify Quick Start <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/guide/3.0/quickstart-openstack.html"> OpenStack Tutorial.</a> Devstack defaults for the cloudify-config.yaml:</p>

Next we will follow quick start guide steps. To verify the the bootstrapping succeeded after you ran the cty bootstrap command, you may run cfy status and get the IP of the Cloudify management node and a list of the running services on it. Before executing the blueprint upload step in the guide,there are a couple of environment changes to the blueprint.yaml to match our Devstack environment:

<p>Once you are done with the steps in the quick guide, you can view the node-cellar deployment also from you Devstack horizon UI. You will see there the two VMs that were provisioned in addition to the Cloudify management VM. </p>

There we are, Node-cellar is deployed and you can use it as a reference to building and running your own blueprints.</p>
