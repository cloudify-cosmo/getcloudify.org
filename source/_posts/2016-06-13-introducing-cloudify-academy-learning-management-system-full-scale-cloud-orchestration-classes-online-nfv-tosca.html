<h2><i>Introduction by Florian Haas, CEO of <a href="http://hastexo.com">hastexo</a></i></h2>
<p>Every piece of technology in the industry that is worth discussing is elastic and distributed. Whether we're talking OpenStack, Docker/Kubernetes, or systemd/etcd/fleet, every technology platform takes into account the fact that applications must horizontally scale, must elastically adapt to changing demands, and must always be available. Cloudify fits that model exactly. And to understand exactly how it does so, Cloudify Academy is the perfect way to get started.</p>

<p>GigaSpaces chose hastexo's Open edX based platform to allow anyone to try out and test the benefits of Cloudify with minimal effort and zero infrastructure requirements. With Cloudify Academy, based on the technology that also drives <a href="https://academy.hastexo.com/" target="_blank">hastexo Academy</a>, anyone interested can evaluate and test Cloudify in minutes.</p>

<h2>Online TOSCA Course and Lab</h2>
<p>Recently, our team at <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}" target="_blank">Cloudify</a> <a href="http://www.gigaspaces.com/online-tosca-training-now-available-gigaspaces-built-open-source-infrastructure-open-edx-and-opensta" target="_blank">introduced</a> <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/Cloudify-Academy.html" target="_blank">Cloudify Academy</a>, an online Learning Management System which we are building as an education platform to teach cloud architects, DevOps, etc all about cloud orchestration - from the basics to more advanced methods. Our LMS is based on the hastexo Academy platform by hastexo, a long-time GigaSpaces partner that specializes in consulting and training services on open-source distributed infrastructure technology.</p>

<p>The first online course we have created is entitled "<a href="https://lms.getcloudify.org/courses/course-v1:cloudify+cfy100+201606/about" target="_blank">Introduction to TOSCA</a>," which covers the fundemantals of <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/2015/07/21/what-is-TOSCA-cloud-application-orchestration-tutorial-cloudify.html" target="_blank">TOSCA orchestration</a> and how to use Cloudify and TOSCA in your cloud deployments. By the end of this course, users will learn what TOSCA is, what Cloudify does and how it uses TOSCA, and how to deploy and use Cloudify blueprints. Users will then be given a virtual lab environment to test-drive Cloudify TOSCA-based blueprints and deployments.</p>

<h2>NFV Training and Lab</h2>
<p>On top of the TOSCA course, we also have an <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/NFV-Labs-On-Demand.html" target="_blank">online training</a> option for <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/2015/10/13/nfv-vnf-network-topology-architecture-automation-tosca-service-chaining-orchestration.html" target="_blank">NFV orchestration</a> that includes a lab environment built on <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/2014/07/10/what-is-openstack-tutorial.html" target="_blank">OpenStack</a> for users to test NFV blueprint deployment with. The training includes:</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li>An introduction to NFV Orchestration</li>
<li>Basic principles of Virtual Network Function Modeling</li>
<li>Orchestrating vIMS using Clearwater</li>
<li>Orchestrating your first VNF</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>More Resources for Learning</h2>
<p>On top of these courses and training modules, we encourage everyone to have a look at our <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/examples/home.html" target="_blank">Examples Hub</a> to see a large library of Cloudify-built blueprints that you can already use for test deployments.</p>

<p>If you are interested in other content, we have a <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/cloudifysourcetv.html" target="_blank">video library</a> as well with some great videos for you to learn all about cloud orchestration and more.</p>

<p>Finally, if you are looking for something more along the lines of <a href=""></a>container orchestration, we have partnered with the team at <a href="http://mist.io" target="_blank">Mist.io</a> to offer <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/cloudify-kubernetes-orchestration-docker-container-cluster-mist.html" target="_blank">Kubernetes Orchestration as a Service</a> which you can register for and learn how to provision and configure a Kubernetes cluster as well as auto-scale it with these two great, open-source tools.</p>
