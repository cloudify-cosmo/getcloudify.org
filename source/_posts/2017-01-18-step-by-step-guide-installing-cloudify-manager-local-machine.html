<p>Sometimes it helps to have an extra resource for users to get started, beyond the product documentation. So, we are starting a series of blog posts on ways to get started, and deploy applications, with <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}" target="_blank">Cloudify</a> using simple, straightforward instructions without any extra technical notes. We are also working on <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/cloudifysourcetv.html" target="_blank">video tutorials</a> using Cloudify 3.4, so feel to check back for more in the future.</p>

<p>There are a few ways to get started with Cloudify, including pre-baked QCOW and AWS images of Cloudify Manager, which require the user to have an environment pre-prepared. This tutorial, however, will follow a different, more comprehensive path to running Cloudify Manager on your local machine which doesn't require any cloud environment prep.</p>

<p>The prerequisites required for this tutorial are to install <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads" target="_blank">Virtualbox</a> and <a href="https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html" target="_blank">Vagrant</a> and you will also need at least 2GB of free RAM. Also, feel free to keep files in a specific folder of your choice in order to keep track of everything.</p>

<p>Once you&rsquo;ve installed both of those pieces of software, you can head over to our <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/downloads/get_cloudify.html" target="_blank">Download Page</a> and click on the &ldquo;Vagrant Box&rdquo; button to download the file.</p>

<p class="aligncenter"><img src="/img/blog/vagrantdl.png"></p>

<p><em>PLEASE NOTE: The below step can take some time as the package contents are over 1GB in size.</em></p>

<p>Next, head over to your terminal (Linux or Mac) or the command line (Windows) and make sure you get to the folder in which the Vagrantfile was saved. Then, type the command <code>vagrant up</code> and hit enter. This will grab the actual package information, set up networking, the user account, SSH keys, and actually boot up the VM in Virtualbox for you. This makes it simple to SSH right into the machine.</p>

<p>When that process has successfully finished, simply go to <a href="http://10.10.1.10/" target="_blank">http://10.10.1.10/</a> on your web browser of choice and you will see Cloudify Manager showing the UI.</p>

<p class="aligncenter"><img src="/img/blog/cloudify_ui.png"></p>

<p>The next step is to SSH into the machine in order to deploy your application blueprints locally. For Windows users, you will need to download an SSH client. Once again, head over to your terminal and type in <code>vagrant ssh</code> which will get you into Cloudify Manager.</p>

<p class="aligncenter"><img src="/img/blog/vagrantssh.png"></p>

<p>Just to verify that you have a proper running Manager, you can type in <code>cfy status</code> to show that each of Cloudify Manager&rsquo;s components are in order. And that&rsquo;s all there is to it!</p>
