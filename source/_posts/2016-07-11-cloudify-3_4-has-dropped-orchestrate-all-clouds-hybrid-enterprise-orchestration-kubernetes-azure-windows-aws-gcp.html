<p>Team Cloudify is very excited to announce the Cloudify 3.4 GA release! This was definitely the most <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/downloads/releasenotes/release-notes-3_4_0.html">packed release</a> of Cloudify ever and brings with it some major improvements, all of which culminates in support for hybrid environments, with any stack, and on any workload, and covering more than 90% of infrastructures and workloads used by major enterprises.</p>

<p>We are proud to introduce our latest Cloudify plugins for <a href="http://docs.getcloudify.org/3.4.0/plugins/azure/">Microsoft Azure</a> and <a href="https://github.com/cloudify-cosmo/cloudify-gcp-plugin">Google Cloud Platform</a> (GCP). These join our now fully open source VMware plugins for <a href="http://docs.getcloudify.org/3.4.0/plugins/vsphere/">vSphere</a> and <a href="http://docs.getcloudify.org/3.4.0/plugins/vcloud/">vCloud</a>, as well as <a href="http://docs.getcloudify.org/3.4.0/plugins/aws/">AWS</a> and <a href="http://docs.getcloudify.org/3.4.0/plugins/openstack/">OpenStack</a> plugins. We also have more robust support for Windows on all supported clouds.</p>
<p>In the realm of hybrid workloads, our <a href="https://github.com/cloudify-examples/kubernetes-cluster-blueprint">enhanced Kubernetes support</a> now gives users the ability to <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/2016/04/04/scaling-kubernetes-microservices-openstack-TOSCA-orchestration-cloud-open-source.html">deploy Kubernetes</a> on any cloud, manage microservices on top of Kubernetes along with stateful services, and trigger auto-scaling and auto-healing of microservices and Kubernetes minions.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s get into some of the major improvements under the hood.</p>
<p><strong>Orchestration Enhancements</strong></p>
<p>Users can now make <a href="http://docs.getcloudify.org/3.4.0/manager/update-deployment/">live topology changes</a> to running deployments and include new resources. Also, our <a href="http://docs.getcloudify.org/3.4.0/blueprints/spec-imports/">blueprint composition</a> feature allows users to decompose large blueprints into importable parts so that they're more easily manageable and organized. In 3.5, we plan to provide the ability to compose applications from multiple services (blueprints).</p>

<p>On top of that, the <a href="http://docs.getcloudify.org/3.4.0/blueprints/multiple-instances/#node-templates-scalable-configuration">resource grouping</a> feature allows one-to-one scaling of relationships and groups of resources. Another scalability improvement was the overhaul of the Management Worker architecture, which removes the dedicated deployment workers and consolidates all task executions to be handled by the Management Worker.</p>
<p><strong>Cloudify Manager Upgrades and Bootstrap Quick Install</strong></p>
<p>Cloudify Manager <a href="http://docs.getcloudify.org/3.4.0/manager/upgrade/">in-place upgrades</a> are now available from 3.4.x! Users will be able to upgrade all manager components making the upgrade process smoother and simpler. In order to do this, we introduced another feature called <a href="http://docs.getcloudify.org/3.4.0/manager/maintenance-mode/" target="_blank">Maintenance Mode</a> which safely stops any running service and prevents the user from triggering any new executions during the update process.</p>
<div class="aligncenter"><img src="http://docs.getcloudify.org/3.4.0/images/guide/manager-upgrade-flow-diagram.png" alt="" width="600" /></div><br>
<p>The team also worked hard to make bootstrap significantly faster and easier. Bootstrapping a manager is as simple as <a href="http://docs.getcloudify.org/3.4.0/manager/bootstrapping/">installing a tar file</a> or using our <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/downloads/get_cloudify.html">AMI or QCOW</a> (OpenStack) images for quick installation on those clouds.</p>
<p><strong>Web UI Improvements</strong></p>
<p>Our UI team has added many great new features to make Cloudify Manager management easier. The new and improved UI layout takes advantage of screen real estate and new Snapshots and Plugins management views were added as well for ease of use. Manager Maintenance mode is also available from the UI directly.</p>
<p><strong>Cloudify CLI</strong></p>
<p>After giving a lot of thought to the process of installing applications using Cloudify Manager, we significantly shortened the process of deploying the application using the CLI. To do this, the <a href="http://docs.getcloudify.org/3.4.0/cli/install/" target="_blank">&lsquo;install&rsquo; command</a> now runs the &lsquo;upload&rsquo;, &lsquo;create&rsquo;, and &lsquo;execute&rsquo; commands all in one, saving the user time and effort. </p>

<p><strong>Cloudify Composer</strong></p>
<p>Our Composer, the graphical editor for creating YAML blueprints in a drag and drop environment, has been updated with some new features, including <a href="http://docs.getcloudify.org/3.4.0/composer/installation/">Linux and Mac script-based installation</a>, the ability to <a href="http://docs.getcloudify.org/3.4.0/composer/blueprint-creation/#using-and-managing-stencils">load and manage additional node types</a>, and the ability upload blueprints directly into Cloudify Composer.</p>
