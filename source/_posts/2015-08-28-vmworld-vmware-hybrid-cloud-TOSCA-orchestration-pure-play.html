  <p>Ah, VMworld. A place for IT pros and thought leaders to come together and talk virtualization and cloud technology. This year, the name of the game is “Ready for Any,” showcasing the VMware ecosystem for fast and secure architectures and unified hybrid cloud that lets users “innovate like a startup and execute like an enterprise.”</p>

  <p>And this notion of <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/2015/02/13/hybrid-cloud-tosca-vmware-orchestration-vcloud-vsphere.html">hybrid cloud </a>is as poignant as ever, with more enterprises extending their existing workloads across a VMware stack, or between different clouds altogether. Everyone wants to function like the Google’s, Facebook’s and Netflix’s of the world, running deployments seamlessly across a myriad of environments without a hitch.</p>

  <p>In the real world, we know it doesn’t quite work that way. Running applications across disparate environments and keeping up with cool new tools and the hottest technology is no easy task. Bottom line is - the only constant that we can truly rely on is change itself.</p>

  <p class="aligncenter"><img src="/img/blog/pure-play-cloud-orchestration-vmworld.png" alt=""></p>

  <p>Embrace change.</p>

  <p>Keeping up with the speed of innovation is Cloudify’s sweetspot - and now we are about to unveil a new project that will sweeten it even more for <a href="https://solutionexchange.vmware.com/store/products/tosca-based-orchestration-for-vmware-vcloud-air-public-cloud#.VdxzQvlVhBc">VMware vCloud® Air™</a> users. Over the last few months we’ve been working with VMware to simplify how vCloud Air users deploy applications across the VMware stack or into hybrid environments using Cloudify’s pure-play, open source, <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/2015/07/21/what-is-TOSCA-cloud-application-orchestration-tutorial-cloudify.html">TOSCA standard</a>-based orchestration. </p>

  <p>And don’t just take our word for it, see for yourself.</p>

  <p>The Cloudify team will be on site at <a href="http://www.vmworld.com/en/us/index.html">VMworld </a>to show you how this all works. We will have a booth in the DevOps Zone in the Hang Space outside the expo hall, where we will be hosting live demos of <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/vmware-hybrid-cloud.html">Cloudify Orchestration for VMware </a>at 1pm and 4pm daily throughout the conference. Can’t make those times? Not to worry. Come by the booth and request your demo on demand.</p>

  <p>You can also find us in the vCloud Air Pavilion and in the <a href="http://www.vce.com/landing/vmworld">VCE </a>booth in the expo hall where members of our team will be running demos of Cloudify for vCloud Air and VCE.</p>

  <p>Cloudify’s CTO Nati Shalom will be giving a talk on Cloudify for VMware alongside VMware’s Paco Gomez, Senior Solutions Architect for vCloud Air and Michael Cincinatus, Sr. Director Product Marketing vCloud Air. Their talk, “<a href="https://vmworld2015.lanyonevents.com/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=6059">Orchestrating Applications at vCloud Air</a>,” will be held on Wednesday, September 2 at 2:00 pm PDT. </p>
