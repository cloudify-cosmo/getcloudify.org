  <p>Team Cloudify is heading to the <a href="https://www.openstack.org/summit/openstack-paris-summit-2014/" target="_blank">OpenStack Summit</a> in Paris to present cross-cloud orchestration capabilities of its open source application <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/cloud_orchestration_cloud_automation.html" target="_blank">orchestration</a> platform. With <a href="http://www.gigaspaces.com/bringing-new-intelligence-cloud-orchestration-cloudify-30" target="_blank">Cloudify's</a> recent re-architecture and compliance with the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/openstack-architecture-cloudify.html#TOSCA" target="_blank">TOSCA</a> specification, the platform is even more deeply compatible with <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/2014/09/02/Open-Cloud-OpenStack-Cloud.html" target="_blank">OpenStack</a> technology, providing an orchestration platform for deployment, management and scaling of any OpenStack project.</p>

  <p>At the summit, GigaSpaces will present, both in talks as well as in the Expo, how they have enhanced Cloudify's <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/2014/09/11/hybrid-cloud-openstack-multi-cloud.html" target="_blank">hybrid cloud</a> support, and cross-cloud portability capabilities between OpenStack and VMware's vSphere and vCloud Air. Cloudify's new integration with Docker enables porting of software packages across operating systems and images. The porting of a <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/2014/10/30/Docker-cloud-orchestration-configuration-management.html" target="_blank">Docker container</a> coupled with Cloudify's cross-cloud orchestration allows OpenStack users to expand their deployments into other environments using common management, automation and monitoring tools.</p>

  <p>As Cloudify's blueprint architecture is compliant with the TOSCA specification (Topology and Orchestration Specification for Cloud Applications), users are not tied to a specific orchestration platform. </p>

  <p>Cloudify users include large banks that use Cloudify for DevOps automation that works across their OpenStack and VMware environments.&#160; In addition, they intend to use Cloudify as an alternative to their legacy compute data grid. </p>

  <p>Carriers and Telecom organizations use Cloudify for orchestrating their Network Functions Virtualization (NFV) to reduce costs and increase flexibility of their carrier-grade PaaS offerings.</p>

  <p>Other Cloudify highlights in the upcoming product release 3.1 include:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>TOSCA-based Orchestration</li>

    <li>Built-in Network Orchestration</li>

    <li><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/docker-orchestration-docker-container-deployment-cloud.html" target="_blank">Docker Orchestration</a></li>

    <li>Management and Monitoring</li>

    <li>Built-in Policy and Workflow Engine</li>
  </ul>

  <p>At the Cloudify booth (E50 in the Expo hall), there will be live demos showcasing the portability between and OpenStack and VMware as well as the service orchestration for NFV. In addition, CTO and industry thought-leader Nati Shalom will be<a href="https://openstacksummitnovember2014paris.sched.org/event/2b85b682ccaf3a5961e463b61e2403f8#.VFKC4PnF83k"> presenting</a> application and <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/2014/03/10/network_automation_openstack_orchestration.html" target="_blank">network orchestration</a> using <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/openstack-architecture-cloudify.html#Heat" target="_blank">Heat</a> &amp; TOSCA on Monday, November 3 from 3:20pm - 4:00pm.</p></p>
