<p>This article aims to introduce <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/2014/12/21/oasis-TOSCA-cloud-openstack-heat-orchestration-spec.html">TOSCA</a> (Topology and Orchestration Specification for Cloud Applications) in the simplest of terms, so that users understand what it is, why it’s important to <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/downloads/get_cloudify.html">Cloudify</a>, and some of its basic concepts.</p>

<h2><font style="font-weight: bold">What is TOSCA in a nutshell?</font></h2>

<p>First, TOSCA is a specification that aims to standardize how we describe software applications and everything that is required for them to run in the “cloud”.</p>

<p>This means that <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/2015/01/07/VNF-network-function-virtualization-netconf-yang-NFV.html">TOSCA</a> provides a way to describe not only an application, but also its dependencies and supporting (cloud) infrastructure.</p>

<h2><font style="font-weight: bold">What are the basic concepts of TOSCA?</font></h2>

<p>There are two basic building blocks in TOSCA: nodes and relationships.</p>

<p>A node can be an infrastructure component, like a subnet, a network, a server (it can even represent a cluster of servers), or it can be a software component, like a service or a runtime environment.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, a relationship describes how nodes are connected to one another.</p>

<p>TOSCA has the notion of types.</p>

<p>For example, a “compute” node, which represents a resource with a CPU. These types can be used in “service templates”, or, as they are called in Cloudify, “blueprints”.</p>

<p>In the blueprint, a node type is used in a “node template”. So in Cloudify, a server could look like this:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/yeshess/91c2eafd0c460a368bb4.js"></script>

<p>This is a node template named “some_virtual_host”, and it is of the node type “cloudify.nodes.Compute”.</p>

<p>Both nodes and relationships may have programmable implementations, so that an orchestrator, such as Cloudify, can read their definition in the blueprint, and call certain actions.</p>

<p>So for example, in Cloudify, this can represented thusly:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/yeshess/b2959586a59c56039b45.js"></script>

<p>Base types, whether they are node types or relationship types, can be derived by user to create new types. Here we demonstrate a hypothetical derivation of the Compute type into a “BladeServer” type.</p>

<h2><font style="font-weight: bold">How is Cloudify Related to TOSCA?</font></h2>

<p>In a market of young <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/cloud_orchestration_cloud_automation.html">cloud orchestration tools</a> and products, Cloudify aims to be the best that is implementing this standard.</p>

<p>Cloudify’s DSL is based on TOSCA’s YAML Simple Profile, which his a way of writing <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/2015/06/19/docker-tosca-cloud-orchestration-openstack-heat-kubernetes.html">TOSCA blueprints</a> in YAML. (Originally, TOSCA is written in XML, but since XML has lots of unnecessary punctuation, the YAML profile is easier to use.)</p>

<p>Part of Cloudify’s core is the Cloudify DSL Parser, which aspires to read and validate TOSCA (YAML) blueprints, and provide a mechanism for mapping operations to <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/2015/01/06/cloudify-cloud-open-source-workflow-engine-automation-template-tools-plugin.html">Cloudify plugins</a>.</p>

<p>All TOSCA blueprints specify the TOSCA definitions version adhered to in the blueprint. In Cloudify, we are currently using a specific Cloudify DSL version that looks for namespacing specific to Cloudify.</p>

<p>In the next few versions of Cloudify, the DSL will be expanded to include more features of TOSCA that have not been discussed here.</p>

<p>Even today, they are quite close. In this article, I’ve provided Cloudify code snippets, instead of TOSCA ones.</p>

<p>This snippet:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/yeshess/b2959586a59c56039b45.js"></script>

<p>Could just as easily be:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/yeshess/77ed058c31b98264ba5a.js"></script>

<p>A full discussion of where TOSCA and the Cloudify DSL align is beyond the scope of this article, as are the full features of Cloudify.</p>

<p>Instead, I’ve focused on outlining TOSCA basics. TOSCA is meant to be easy to adopt, and I hope that this article has helped in introducing the elementary concepts.</p>

<p>For further reading, I suggest the <a href="http://docs.oasis-open.org/tosca/TOSCA-Simple-Profile-YAML/v1.0/csd03/TOSCA-Simple-Profile-YAML-v1.0-csd03.html">TOSCA Simple Profile doc</a>.</p>

<p>I also recommend the documentation on Cloudify’s DSL for Cloudify version 3.2: <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/guide/3.2/dsl-spec-general.html">Cloudify DSL</a></p>

<p>In my upcoming blog posts, I will begion to expand on TOSCA and Cloudify with more advanced examples.</p>
