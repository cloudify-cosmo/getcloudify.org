<p><a href="http://openstacksv.com/" target="_blank">OpenStack Silicon Valley</a> is just a few short days away and we are looking forward to talking OpenStack with the local community.</p>

<p>A main focus for Team Cloudify at the event will be around the topic of portability AKA <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/cloud_orchestration_cloud_automation.html#HPLink" target="_blank">hybrid cloud</a>, not only between environments, but also between OpenStack and non-OpenStack environments. In July we announced the release of <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/cloud_orchestration_cloud_automation.html">Cloudify 3</a>, a complete rewrite and redesign of Cloudify.&#160; This change provides an intelligent orchestration and management platform that is even more compatible with the open source world of <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/openstack-architecture-cloudify.html" target="_blank">OpenStack</a>. The platform is designed to integrate with any tool chain and provide interoperability across stacks and environments.</p>

<p>Why the focus on portability? It is our core belief that for the foreseeable future, supporting hybrid clouds is going to be important for many OpenStack users. Here are a couple of reasons why:</p>

<ol>
  <li><b>Transitioning to OpenStack is a long journey</b> - Many enterprises are based on VMware as their core infrastructure. Often, those organizations begin their journey to OpenStack by creating a dev environment and gradually moving more of their workload onto OpenStack as they become more accustomed to the new environment. This process typically spans the course of months and sometimes years. It is clear that during this period of transition, customers will continue to use vSphere and vCloud in parallel with OpenStack. For those users, having a common platform with which to manage their app deployment across those two environments can ease the transition and reduce the risk of hitting a roadblock if one of the environments does not meet their needs.</li>

  <li><b>The public cloud market is going to be dominated by non-OpenStack clouds</b> - While OpenStack is on a trajectory to dominate the private cloud market, the public cloud market is led by AWS with other major clouds emerging, such as GCE and Azure. Many organizations would not want to host their entire data center on a private cloud and would, therefore, need to take a hybrid cloud approach. In order to support hybrid cloud environments, an abstraction layer is needed to enable integration with clouds other than OpenStack.</li>
</ol>

<p>While we strongly believe in the necessity of supporting hybrid deployments, the integration with OpenStack was a major consideration when redesigning the Cloudify platform. By switching to Python code, developing compatibility with Heat and supporting the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/openstack-architecture-cloudify.html#TOSCA" target="_blank">TOSCA</a> specification, Cloudify is now more than ever more deeply integrated with OpenStack’s core services.</p>

<p>This deeper integration with OpenStack technology makes Cloudify even more equipped to handle the task of <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/openstack-architecture-cloudify.html#multi-cloud" target="_blank">multi-cloud</a> deployment and management between OpenStack and not-only-OpenStack environments.</p>
