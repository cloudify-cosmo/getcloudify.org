<p>One of great things about <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}" targ="_blank">Cloudify</a> is that many of us working here have previously worked as production engineers before, and we apply the same principles that made us good engineers there, into making a better product here, which is intended for the users we used to be.</p>

<p>Monitoring\Alerting\Logging (which I personally feel have become so intertwined that it is difficult to discuss one without going into another) is one of those disciplines that I personally feel strongly about, so I decided to give a talk about it.</p>

<p>So, I recently had the pleasure of speaking and participating in Baltic <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/tags/DevOps/index.html" target="_blank">Devops</a> 2016 in Tallinn, Estonia. Everything worked great from the moment I got off the plane to the point where I got back on 2 days later, and the <a href="https://heathenasparagus.wordpress.com/2016/05/15/the-best-run-conference-i-have-ever-attended/">overall conference (and city experience) was great</a>.</p>

<p class="aligncenter"><img src="/img/blog/gilbalticdevops.png"></p>

<p>The title of the talk was: &ldquo;How to do monitoring\alerting\logging that won't make your engineers give up&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The basic premise is: The ways bad monitoring/alerting/logging policies made me frustrated with jobs I've had. How to avoid these exact pitfalls and make your system friendly and keep your engineers happy.</p>

<p>The gist is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Engineers are people just like everyone else</li>
<li>Keeping them happy is in your best interest</li>
<li>Here are the most common pitfalls and how to try to avoid them</li>
</ul>

<p>Keep in mind, not all solutions are right for everyone, and like all things in life, you kind of have to try and see what works for you.</p>
