                                    <p>Join our own Barak Merimovich, for a meetup hosted at GigaSpaces offices, where he will discuss  the notion of DSLs (domain specific languages), why they're needed and why Groovy makes a good fit for implementing them, based on his experience from building a Groovy DSL for Cloudify (GigaSpaces Groovy based open source tool for on boarding and managing application on any cloud).

Testing with Spock - Baruch Sadogursky

We are going to talk about a testing and specification framework for Java and Groovy applications. It's name is Spock and it is written in Groovy, what else can you ask for? But even if you won't ask, it features very fluent and easy to learn specification DSL (no asserts!) integrates everywhere where JUnit integrates, easily extendable and supports any testing methodology (being it test-first, test-last, unit or integration testing or new one that you just invented).


In our session we will show how to write specifications, assertion conditions, data-driven tests and a simple extension. We will also show what geb is (hint - look at the user group name) and how to use it with spock.</p>

				<b class="title">Community Event:  Chef as a foundation for PaaS: How Cloudify Uses Chef</b>
					<p>Let's Meetup! Nati Shalom, will be presenting in San Francisco with OpsCode on October 19<sup>th</sup> - come out and learn about how Cloudify and Chef work together. </p> <p><b>Session Abstract:</b>As PaaS is becoming more prevalent than ever, most PaaS environments and frameworks are still strongly opinionated and allow for very limited control and extensibility.

Extending a PaaS framework requires deep understating of its internals at best, and in many cases in not even possible.

Cloudify, a new open source PaaS framework, has taken a different approach, by using recipes (As opposed to heavyweight coding and platform extension) as means to introduce new application stacks to the PaaS layer. You can think of it as extending the recipe model of Chef to support application level concerns, such as orchestration, dependency management, multi-tier and multi-host deployments, monitoring and autoscaling.

In this meetup, Nati Shalom, CTO and founder of GigaSpaces (the commercial company behind Cloudify) will introduce the foundations of Cloudify, and how it leverages Chef as a key enabler for an open PaaS
framework.

Speaker: Nati Shalom, @natishalom. Nati is the CTO and founder of GigaSpaces Technologies. As a thought leader in Cloud computing, Nati is a frequent presenter at industry conferences, and is actively involved in evangelizing Cloud computing and DevOps. You can read his musings and thoughts in his blog http://natishalom.typepad.com</p>

                                    <p>Don't miss out on GigaSpaces' CTO, Nati Shalom, who will be presenting on "How to Build a Cloud Marketplace - The Easy Way".  <b>Session Abstract:</b> Many cloud providers, both public and private, increasingly face the challenge of offering a growing number of products through their cloud.

It's clear that the DIY model doesn't scale, and often times takes years to accomplish. This is a clear case where a markeplace approach would be a much better fit.

However, there are a number of technical and business challenges involved with building a cloud marketplace for IT products. For example, in order for a cloud marketplace to offer any value, it needs to be able to offer hundreds or potentially even thousands of products, yet at the same time, there's the demand of being able to bring a large number of users into the marketplace - while both of these components need to happen virtually simultaneously - which is no easy feat. In this session, we'll go through several real-life experiences in building cloud marketplaces, and demonstrate how this challenges can be met easily.</p>

                                    <p>Ruby has been the most popular DevOps language to date, providing excellent built-in features for DevOps, as well as being used in leading DevOps tools such as Chef, Puppet, Noah and others. However, for developers focused on the JVM, mastering Ruby and Ruby-based tools is not always a trivial option.

The release of Groovy 2.0, the emergence of new Groovy based DevOps tools such Gradle, Cloudify and Glu, and also a few built-in features in Groovy such as AntBuilder and Grapes, make Groovy a good candidate to serve as a DevOps foundation for JVM-oriented developers.

In this meetup, we'll run a head-to-head showdown between Ruby and Groovy. We'll have experts from both camps debate various DevOps related aspects of both languages such as ease of use, portability, file system and other admin operations support, external process management, security, speed, echo system, etc.

We welcome your involvement, so if you feel you're up to the challenge and want to take part in the showdown, please let us know!</p>
