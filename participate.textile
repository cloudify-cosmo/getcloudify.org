							   <b class="title">Community Event: San Francisco Cloud Mafia - Big Data on OpenStack</b>
								<p>Time for another great tech meetup on all things Openstack! You will hear talks from Gigaspaces and Mirantis. Thank you to our hosts, Demandforce for hosting this event!

Food and drinks will be provided.  As always this event is free to attend, so feel free to pass it around. 

Mirantis:  Presenter: Boris Renski – Co-Founder and EVP and Kirill Ishanov – Director, OpenStack Cloud Services

Topic: Vendor Independent OpenStack Cloud: Install and Demo

OpenStack is the largest open source cloud community in the world. Public distribution of OpenStack is a complete, feature rich product, available for free. In this session, Mirantis will demonstrate how simple it can be to deploy and run a vendor independent OpenStack cloud using exclusively open source tooling.

Gigaspaces: Presenter:Uri Cohen, VP Product Management

Topic: Deploying Your Big Data App on OpenStack

The massive computing and storage resources that are needed to support big data applications make cloud environments an ideal fit. In this session, you'll learn how to build your big data "database on-demand" using MongoDB, Cassandra, Solr, MySQL, or any other big data solution, as well as manage your big data application using a new open source framework called “Cloudify.” All this, on top of the OpenStack cloud.</p>

                                    <p>
					 Chef is an excellent tool for setting up your environment and automating complex IT processes. It promotes the concept of DevOps and managing your infrastructure as code. However, Chef doesn't go beyond the setup phase. The concept of DevOps and recipes can go well beyond setup, to actually accelerate the entire lifecycle of your applications, from setup, to monitoring, through maintaining high availability, and auto-scaling when required.
