                                    <p>Ruby has been the most popular DevOps language to date, providing excellent built-in features for DevOps, as well as being used in leading DevOps tools such as Chef, Puppet, Noah and others. However, for developers focused on the JVM, mastering Ruby and Ruby-based tools is not always a trivial option.

The release of Groovy 2.0, the emergence of new Groovy based DevOps tools such Gradle, Cloudify and Glu, and also a few built-in features in Groovy such as AntBuilder and Grapes, make Groovy a good candidate to serve as a DevOps foundation for JVM-oriented developers.

In this meetup, we'll run a head-to-head showdown between Ruby and Groovy. We'll have experts from both camps debate various DevOps related aspects of both languages such as ease of use, portability, file system and other admin operations support, external process management, security, speed, echo system, etc.

We welcome your involvement, so if you feel you're up to the challenge and want to take part in the showdown, please let us know!</p>
