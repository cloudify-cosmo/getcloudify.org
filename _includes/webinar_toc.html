  <span class="title">How to Manage your Sharded MongoDB Setup on Any Cloud</span>
  <p>MongoDB supports an automated sharding architecture, enabling horizontal scaling across multiple nodes. 

With MongoDB you can convert to a sharded cluster, automatically managing failover and balancing of nodes, with few or no changes to the original application code. 

Managing a sharded mongo setup is no trivial task. 

In this webinar, Uri Cohen, VP Product Management will teach you how to easily set it up, monitor and scale it on any cloud environment using Cloudify.
