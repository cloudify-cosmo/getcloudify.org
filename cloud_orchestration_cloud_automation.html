						<h1>Cloudify <strong>Product Overview</strong></h1>
						<h2><strong>Orchestrate Real Apps on the Cloud with Cloudify</strong></h2>
						<p> Cloudify provides a smooth transition to the cloud and easy automation of even the most complex applications throughout their entire lifecycle. Cloudify orchestrates the creation of the whole cloud infrastructure required for your application, starting from compute resources all the way down to networks and block storage devices. It will then deploy your applications to the cloud (OpenStack or other), monitor their progress and scale them when needed.</p>
						<p>With Cloudify, you won’t be locked in to any one cloud provider or one type of cloud; deploy the same application in your own data center or on the cloud of your choice using your favorite automation and configuration management tools. Monitor, manage and scale your application with Cloudify, whatever the topology or technology stack.</p>

					<h2><strong>Fully Automated Application Lifecycle</strong></h2>
					<p>Managing your applications on the cloud involves a lot of moving parts, and putting all the pieces together is often times error prone. Cloudify automates the entire application lifecycle, from deployment, to monitoring, scaling, failover, continuous delivery and infrastructure upgrades. Automating these processes significantly minimizes both the complexity and the margin of error when managing your app on the cloud.</p></div></div>

					<h2><strong>Effortless Upgrades</strong></h2>
					<p>Cloudify supports post-deployment infrastructure upgrades and fine-tuning via our blueprints or custom commands. These custom commands can be invoked manually or programmatically, through the Cloudify CLI or REST API, invoking the custom command describe in the blueprint. For example, a custom command can define how to acquire a new version of your code and deploy it onto your middleware.</p></div></div>

								<h4>From Blueprint to Production</h4>
								<p>Automate your move to the cloud with Cloudify’s simple blueprints. Blueprints treat your infrastructure as code, mapping out the details needed to run an application: what middleware services it needs to run and their dependencies, how to install them, where to find the application and service binaries, when to spin more instances or terminate existing ones, and even how to monitor the entire app lifecycle.</p>
