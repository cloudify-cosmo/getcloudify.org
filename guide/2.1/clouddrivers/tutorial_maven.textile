This tutorial explains how to develop a custom cloud driver using Maven.

h2. Before You Start

Before you start developing you cloud driver, make sure you have the following:
* "Apache Maven":http://maven.apache.org/
* "Cloudify":../setup/installing_the_cloudify_client
* The security credentials for your cloud's API calls, for accessing your machines using SSH, and if required for accessing your cloud's storage.
<h4 class="info">For example, to obtain security credetials for Openstack, perform the following steps:
<ol><li>Request a login, and its corresponding access key and secret key, from your Openstack administrator. In the @user@ section of the cloud driver configuration file, the access key and secret key correspond to the @user@ and the @apiKey@ attributes respectively.</li>
<li>Generate a SSL key pair file (required for bootstrapping machines) using "HybridFox":http://code.google.com/p/hybridfox/, and save it in the cloud driver's @upload@ folder. In the @user@ section of the cloud driver configuration file, the @keyFile@ attribute is set to the path of the SSL key pair file.

* "Create cloud images":../setup/post_installation_configuration#images

h2. Configure your Maven @pom@ File

# Add the @jar@ dependency
<script src="https://gist.github.com/3144045.js?file=pom_dependency.xml"></script>
# Add the Cloudify repository
<script src="https://gist.github.com/2070752.js?file=repo.xml"></script>

h2. Create your Cloud Driver

You are now ready to develop your cloud driver. Create a new Java class that implements the _"org.cloudifysource.esc.driver.provisioning.ProvisioningDriver":https://github.com/CloudifySource/cloudify/blob/master/esc/src/main/java/org/cloudifysource/esc/driver/provisioning/ProvisioningDriver.java_ interface. For examples, see "Default Cloud Driver":https://github.com/CloudifySource/cloudify/blob/master/esc/src/main/java/org/cloudifysource/esc/driver/provisioning/jclouds/DefaultProvisioningDriver.java and "Openstack Cloud Driver":https://github.com/CloudifySource/cloudify/blob/master/esc/src/main/java/org/cloudifysource/esc/driver/provisioning/openstack/OpenstackCloudDriver.java.

h2. Configure your Cloud Driver Configuration File

Next, configure the "@user@":#user and management "@templates@":#management sections of your cloud driver configuration file.

h3(#user). Configure the @user@ section

Configure the user, apiKey, and keyFile for your cloud.
<script src="https://gist.github.com/2042919.js?file=driver_user.groovy"></script>

h3(#management). Configure the @templates@ section

Configure the management machines and their corresponding images for your cloud.
<script src="https://gist.github.com/2070794.js?file=templates.groovy"></script>

Next, configure the @managementMachineTemplate@ attribute in your recipe to use the management machine templates:
<script src="https://gist.github.com/2070776.js?file=driver.groovy"></script>

h2. Packing and Adding to Cloudify

Finally, package your cloud driver class, and any additional classes and resources that it depends on, as a jar file and place it in the @<cloudifyRoot>/lib/platform/esm@ folder. Additionally, place your cloud driver configuration file and security certificate in the @<cloudifyRoot>/tools/cli/plugins/esc@ folder.

To make your cloud driver available to the machines in your cloud, perform the following steps:
# Repackage the Cloudify distribution file with your cloud driver files, and save it in a location that can be accessed by your cloud machine.
# On the machine where Cloudify is installed, edit the cloud driver configuration file, and in the @provider@ section, specify the @cloudifyUrl@ attribute (Cloudify installation source) as the location of the Cloudify distribution file.
<h4 class="info">When you bootstrap your cloud, Cloudify uses the local cloud driver configuration file and passes it to the bootstrapped cloud for use when provisioning machines.</h4>

h4(info). To speed up the testing when developing cloud drivers, you can place the cloud driver jar files in the @<cloudName>/upload/Cloudify-overrides/lib/platform/esm@ folder on your local machine and Cloudify will upload them to provisioned machines from your local machine.
