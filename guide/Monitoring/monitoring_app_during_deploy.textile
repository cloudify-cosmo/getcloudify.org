h1. Monitoring the application during deployment using the Cloudify client

During the deployment you can also view the current status in the Cloudify shell console.
In the console you can see at every moment:
* The number of planned instances
* The number of installed instances
* Success or failure of each of the services and its stage(life cycle event).
