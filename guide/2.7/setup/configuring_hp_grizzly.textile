h2. Prerequisites

* An "(newwindow)HP Cloud":http://www.hpcloud.com/ account
* Cloudify shell (for information about installing the Cloudify shell, see "Installing the Cloudify Shell":../setup/installing_the_cloudify_client)

h2. Configuring an HP Grizzly Cloud

This section provides step-by-step instructions for the following configuration tasks:

# "Generate a private key":#key
# "Configure the Cloudify cloud driver configuration file":#driver

h3(#key). Generate a private key

# In the HP web console, under "Key Pairs":https://manage.hpcloud.com/compute/100/keypairs, click *Create Key Pair*, and then type a name for the key pair.
!../../images/hp/compute_create_new_key_pair_hp_cloud_services.png!
# Copy the key and save it as a @.pem@ private key file (e.g. @myKeyPair-name.pem@) in the @<cloudifyRoot>/clouds/hp/upload@ folder.

h4(info). The private key enables the Cloudify cloud driver to open SSH connections to the newly created instances.

h3(#driver). Configure the Cloudify cloud driver configuration file

Edit the HP cloud driver configuration file (@hp-cloud.groovy@) located in the @<cloudifyRoot>/clouds/hp/@ folder, and modify the following attributes:
* In the *provider* section: 
** *machineNamePrefix* -- The value that you specify is used as the name prefix for each of your service instances.
** *managementOnlyFiles* -- An array containing a list of files to copy to management machines and not agent machines. Use this list to specify files such as the private key file (e.g. @myKeyPair-name.pem@) required by the cloud driver..
** *managementGroup* -- The value that you specify is used as the name prefix for each of your management instances.
* In the *user* section:
** *user* -- Specify your credentials *Tenant Name:User Name*. 
*** Tenant Name is actually the project's name (listed on the top left corner in the horizon dashboard).
*** The User name is the same value as used in the "(newwindow)HP console":https://horizon.hpcloud.com/auth/login
** *apiKey* -- Specify your corresponding *API Key*.
*** This is the same as the password used in the "(newwindow)HP console":https://horizon.hpcloud.com/auth/login
** *keyFile* -- Specify the name of the private key file that you created (@myKeyPair-name.pem@ in our example).
* In the *templates* section:  				 
** *imageId*--Specify the *HP Image ID* and *Region* (Region/imageId) . e.g. : region-b.geo-1/202e7659-f7c6-444a-8b32-872fe2ed080c
There are doznes of image ids per region. Examples for CentOS and Ubuntu are provided with the default properties file.
** *hardwareId* -- Specify the HP *Machine Size ID* and *Region* (Region/hardwareId) . e.g. : region-b.geo-1/102
<br/>
The following is a subset of HP OpenStack Hardware Ids:

|_. ID |_. Flavor Name |_. Cores |_. RAM |_. Disk |
|100|standard.xsmall| 1 | 1 GB | 10 GB |
|101|standard.small| 2 | 2 GB | 30 GB |
|102|standard.medium| 2 | 4 GB | 30 GB |
|103|standard.large| 4 | 8 GB | 30 GB |
|104|standard.xlarge| 4 | 15 GB | 30 GB |
|105|standard.2xlarge| 8 | 30 GB | 30 GB |

<br/>
** *username* -- Specify a username to log in to newly the created machine. This user is created as part of the image you selected. e.g. root or ubuntu
** *options* ("jclouds":http://www.jclouds.org/documentation)
*** *keyPair* -- Specify the name of the key pair that you created (whose content is in the .pem file in *keyFile* attribute in the user section).
** custom
*** *availabilityZone*  -- This is the availability zone in which the machine will be created, e.g. "az1"
*** This setting is mandatory in case the storage functionality is required.

<h4 class="impt">For setting the cloud driver, we reccomend that you use "parameterization of the cloud driver configuration":../clouddrivers/cloud_driver#gstr, but you can also set the cloud driver directly as shown in the following example (of an @hp-grizzly-cloud.groovy@ file):</h4>
