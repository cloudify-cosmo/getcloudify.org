When "bootstrapping":../bootstrapping/bootstrapping_process.html your cloud, the services defined in the recipes are provisioned as part of the bootstrapping process. However, when testing and developing recipes, or when deploying services that have no dependencies, you might want to deploy these services individually instead of as part of an application.

This topic explains how to deploy services to your Cloudify deployment.

h2. Deploying a Service

Once you have described your new "service recipe":../developing/service_recipe.html and its dependencies, you are ready to deploy the new service.

The following procedure describes the steps for deploying the service:
# Connect to the REST service -- At the Cloudify shell prompt, type: *@connect@* @<RESTservice>@
# Set the current application context -- At the Cloudify shell prompt, type: *@use-application@* @<appName>@
# Deploy the service -- At the Cloudify shell prompt, type: *@install-service@* @<serviceName>@


h3(#dsbl). Disable Self Healing

Setting the *disableSelfHealing* option in the install command will prevent the service instances from shutting down in case of an error in a lifecycle event. The service will just remain in an error state until the service is uninstalled. 
This is useful for debugging services in actual cloud environments.
e.g : At the Cloudify shell prompt, type: *@install-service@* @-disableSelfHealing@ @<serviceName>@


h3. Deploying with properties (Recipe Parameterization)

During the installation you can use an external properties file to override properties in the service recipe.
To do so use the install-service commands with the -overrides flag, pointing to an external properties file.
The file may contain groovy statements in the same manner as the internal recipe properties file.

In the first stage of the deployment, Cloudify packages your recipe and uploads it to the Cloudify controller. Then, a fully-automated deployment takes place, exactly as described in the recipe. You can monitor the deployment progress in the following ways:
* "Cloudify shell":#monitor --During the deployment, progress information is displayed in the shell
* "Cloudify web management console":../monitoring/the_web_management_console.html --Once the deployment has completed, you can verify the installation using the *Services* view in the web management console.
<h4 class="impt">When the service displays in the web management console, it *is* connected to the other services in the application _even though_ the connecting line/arrow is missing.</h4>
* Review the installation logs

h2(#monitor). Monitoring your Deployment

In the Cloudify shell used to run your service deployment, you can monitor its progress using the following information displayed in the shell:

* The number of planned service instances as described in the recipe.
* Detailed progress about the <span style="color:green;">success</span> or <span style="color:red;">failure</span> of each lifecycle event run. Additionally, Cloudify plots a dot every two seconds to indicate the progress of the current action.

The following example shows the progress of a successful deployment of the *apacheLB* service.

h2. Undeploying a Service

To uninstall the service, at the Cloudify shell prompt, type: *@uninstall-service@* @<serviceName>@

h2(#fail). In Case of Failures

In case of a lifecycle event failure (for instance, an install script failing), the service instance is shut down (the stop and shutdown events are invoked). 
Cloudify then starts a new instance from scratch, calling the init, install and start events. 
Cloudify does NOT kill the machine itself. 
When a service instance is shut down, Cloudify deletes its service directory.
Cleaning up every additional resource from the local file system is the responsibility of the service. 

If the service instance was started successfully, but then the underlying process (JBoss, for example) dies unexpectedly, we call the Stop lifecycle events, and then the *Start events to restart the process (i.e. we do not uninstall/install the service instance).

If the machine itself dies, Cloudify starts a new one.
