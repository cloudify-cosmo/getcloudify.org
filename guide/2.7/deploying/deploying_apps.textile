This topic explains how to deploy your applications using Cloudify.

h2. Deploying your Application

Once your "application recipe":../developing/recipes_overview.html and its dependencies are ready, and you have "bootstrapped":../bootstrapping/bootstrapping_process.html your cloud, you can now deploy the application.

The following procedure describes the steps for deploying your application:
# Connect to the REST service--At the Cloudify shell prompt, type: *@connect@* @<RESTservice>@
# Deploy the application--At the Cloudify shell prompt, type: *@install-application@* @<appName>@

h3(#dsbl). Disable Self Healing

Setting the *disableSelfHealing* option in the install command will prevent the service instances from shutting down in case of an error in a lifecycle event. The service will just remain in an error state until the service is uninstalled. 
This is useful for debugging applications in actual cloud environments.
e.g : At the Cloudify shell prompt, type: *@install-application@* @-disableSelfHealing@ @<appName>@

h3. Deploying with properties (Recipe Parameterization)

During the installation you can use an external properties file to override properties in the application and services recipes.
To do so use the install-application commands with the -overrides flag, pointing to an external properties file.
The file may contain groovy statements in the same manner as the internal recipe properties files.

In the first stage of the deployment, Cloudify packages your recipe and uploads it to the Cloudify controller. Then, a fully-automated deployment takes place, exactly as described in the recipe. You can monitor the deployment progress in the following ways:
* "Cloudify shell":#monitor --During the deployment, progress information is displayed in the shell
* "Cloudify web management console":../monitoring/the_web_management_console.html --Once the deployment has completed, you can verify the installation using the *Application* view in the web management console.html
* Review the installation logs

h2(#monitor). Monitoring your Deployment

In the Cloudify shell used to run your application deployment, you can monitor its progress using the following information displayed in the shell:

* The number of planned service instances as described in the application recipe and their interdependencies.
* Detailed progress about each service being deployed and started, including the <span style="color:green;">success</span> or <span style="color:red;">failure</span> of each lifecycle event run. Additionally, Cloudify plots a dot every two seconds to indicate the progress of the current action.

The following example shows the progress of a successful deployment of the PetClinic application.

In the event that a deployment fails to complete, Cloudify displays an error message in red.

The following examples shows the progress of a deployments that failed due to a recipe compilation error.

The following examples shows the progress of a deployments that failed because the application is already deployed.

h2. Undeploying

The following table lists the various commands for uninstalling all or part of an application and its environment.

|_. Command |_. Description |
| *@uninstall-service@* @serviceName@ | Uninstalls the specified service |
| *@uninstall-application@* @appName@ | Uninstalls all services and the specified application |
| *@teardown-localcloud@* | Uninstalls all services and the application, and shuts down all machines in a localcloud. For other clouds, use @teardown-cloud@ |
