h1. Overview

Cloudify 2.7 provides network abstraction to allow applications to define and create their network topology as part
of the application deployment.

Currently, Cloudify offers network implementation for OpenStack using the Neutron API and the
corresponding attributes in Nova API.

Users who wish to have custom implementations can refer to the custom Cloud Driver guide //link here

Cloudify supported network use cases includes:

- Creating a Cloudify management network to which the Cloudify Managers are bind as well as Cloudify agents (using a dedicated vNIC)
this use case provides separation of management networking from application networking. In this use case the bootstrap
process uses the network cloud driver to create a network and a router that binds the internal network to the external network
in order to provide internet connectivity for the REST and GUI endpoints.

Scope of support:
Assign multiple virtual networks to VMs using multiple vNIC  - networks can be predefined or provisioned by Cloudify
Security Group definitions in recipe: Create security groups and bind VMs to these groups
Network templates: create networks for applications and services using templates in the Cloud Driver configuration
Create, terminate bind and unbind floating IPs using API from the recipe


Bootstrapping Cloudify with Management network for managers and agent - Bootstrap process binds to
 management network and subnet predefined with a router to link the management subnet to the external network (REST & GUI endpoints).
Installing application with networks, security groups and floating Ips.  Cloud Driver binds to:
application networks and subnets predefined
 security groups which are predefined
If floating IP API is to be used - user must have the network bind to an external network via router


Bootstrapping Cloudify with Management network for managers and agent - Bootstrap process creates
management network and subnet.
A router to link the management subnet to the external network (REST & GUI endpoints).
Installing application with networks, security groups and floating Ips.  Cloud Driver creates:
application networks and subnets on based on user's configuration.
Security groups as defined in the recipes
 ports are created when VMs are attached to a subnet.
