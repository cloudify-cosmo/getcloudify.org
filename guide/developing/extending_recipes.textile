Cloudify recipes are like object-oriented classes in that they can be extended.

h2. Why Extend?

In many scenarios, you may want to create a new service which is based on an already existing service, overriding only parts of it with your own modifications. For example, you may want to use the Tomcat recipe (that's included in the Cloudify distribution under @<cloudifyInstallationFolder>@) with a few modifications, without needing to copy the existing recipe and all of its relevant content.

h2. How does Extending Work?

Extending recipes follows the following simple rules:
* *Recursion*--The extend mechanism is recursive, which means that one service can extend another service, that extends a third service, and so on.
* *Inheritance*--Each extension level inherits from its parent only if a more specific element does not exist in the child recipe.

Thus, a new recipe inherits all attributes and files from its parent recipes only if the attributes or files do not exist in the new recipe.

h4(info). When copying files from a parent recipe to a child recipe, they are copied to the child service's deployment folder.

Extending recipes works for any of the elements of a service recipe, whether they are top-level elements (e.g. @lifecycle@) or more specific elements (e.g. @lifecycle -> init@.

For example, consider the following parent service recipe:
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1821896.js?file=service.groovy"></script>

The extending service recipe can, for example, add @stop@ behavior and/or change only the @init@ behavior, while keeping the @postStart@ behavior of the extended service.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/1821900.js?file=service.groovy"></script>

h2. Extending Recipes

Cloudify makes extending a recipe easy.

h3. To extend a recipe
# In your application recipe, create a new service recipe file (e.g. my-tomcat-service.groovy).
# For the first attribute of the service block, specify the @extend@ attribute using the path to the service recipe being extended as its value, as follows:
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1821880.js?file=service.groovy"></script>

h4(warn). The extend attribute must appear first in the service block for the extension to work.
