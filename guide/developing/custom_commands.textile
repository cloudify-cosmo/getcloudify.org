h1. Custom Commands - What They Are and What They're Good for

In many cases, you want fine grained control over your application service, which is not limited to the built in "lifecycle events":/guide/developing/lifecycle_events. These command can be invoked using the interactive shell, and in the future also the web based UI. Cloudify has a mechanism called "Custom Commands" that allows you to define these commands using Groovy closures, Groovy scripts, or even shell scripts. The commands can be parameterized, so you can transfer parameters to them upon invocation.
This can be a very effective mechanism to implement various application-level concerns, such as hot upgrades (e.g. replacing a .war file with another and refreshing the web container), database schema updates and more.

h1. Defining a Custom Command

Custom commands are defined in a customCommands section in your service recipe. They can contain an array of commands.
Here are some general examples:

h3. * Using a Groovy Script / Shell or Batch Script

<script src="https://gist.github.com/1723535.js?file=custom1.groovy"></script>

h3. * Printing parameters to the console of the executing cloudify agent

The following YOUR_COMMAND_NAME receives two parameters (firstName and lastName) 
todo: and then it prints the content of firstName_lastName.txt.
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1723545.js?file=customCommands2.groovy"></script>
		

<h4 class="noteYellow">When using user-defined Java libraries in your Groovy closures or scripts, make sure to use proper import statement where appropriate, and place the relevant jar files in the usmlib directory of the service for which the commands were defined.</h4>

<h4 class="noteYellow">Any external script invoked by the custom command should be includes in the service folder.</h4>

h1. Where to Place the {{customCommands}} Section in Your Service Recipe

The @customCommands@ section should be placed in the prolog (main) section of the relevant <br/>service file (&lt;service name>-service.groovy). Here's an example:
<script src="https://gist.github.com/2267558.js?file=tomcat.groovy"></script>

h1. Invoking Custom Commands

h3. Invoking from the Interactive Shell

During the "installation and deployment":/guide/deploying/deploying_apps of your application, the custom commands that you specified in the recipe, will be registered for later use.
After your application is up and running, you can activate any of the custom commands at any time from the interactive shell.
	
Here's how to invoke a custom command that requires no parameters:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *@invoke ServiceName customCommandName@*

Here's how to invoke a custom command that requires two parameters (x and y):	
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *@invoke ServiceName customCommandName x y@*

Consider the following scenario:
* You on-boarded your application to a cloud with Cloudify.
* Your application includes one tomcat service.
* After the installation, you fixed a bug in your web application.
* You want to update the .war file without taking own the Tomcat server or its containing VM. In other words, you want to avoid redeploying the entire application.

Custom command can be leveraged to implement this scenario:
* During installation, your tomcat service file should include the following section, which defines an "UpdateWar" custom command:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/1723735.js?file=update_warcc.groovy"></script>

* The tomcat service folder should contain the update_war.groovy script, here's its content:
  <script src="https://gist.github.com/1723340.js?file=update_war.groovy"></script>
* When you'd like to update the .war file:
** Start the Cloudify interactive shell.
** Type: *@connect REST-ADMIN-SERVER-URL@*
** Type: *@use-application YOUR-APP-NAME@*
** Type  *@invoke tomcat updateWar@* and wait for the command to complete.
** If all goes well, your new war should now deployed.
