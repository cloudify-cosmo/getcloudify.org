This topic describes the types of plugins that can be used with Cloudify.

Cloudify recipes can use different types of plugins for detecting and monitoring services. The plugins are described in the @plugins@ section of the service descriptor file.

The following is a list of the different types of plugins:
* *Service Start Detector*--Detects the successful start of a specified service instance. This is used in the service lifecycle to invoke postStart events and dependent services.
* *Service Stop Detector*--Detects a stopped service instance. This is used in the service lifecycle to initiate self-healing process that provisions a new instance of the stopped service.
* *Process Monitoring*--Monitors the operating system process of the specified service.  These metrics are used by the admin API and web management console. The following metrics are collated:
** Process CPU
** Process CPU usage
** Kernel CPU time
** Process Memory
** Number of Page faults
* *Monitoring Plugin*--Monitors custom metrics at regular intervals. These metrics are used by the admin API and web management console.
** Currently, the only built-in monitoring plugin is @org.openspaces.usm.jmx.JmxMonitor@ that uses *JMX Mbeans* attributes.
* *Details Plugin* - Retrieves custom service details. These details are used by the admin API and the web management console.
** Currently, the only built-in monitoring plugin is @org.openspaces.usm.jmx.JmxDetails@ that uses *JMX Mbeans* attributes.

The following diagrams show the different ways of describing plugins in a service recipe, depending on whether they are built-in or custom:

* Custom plugins. When adding custom plugins, they and their dependencies must be saved as @jar@ files in the recipes @usmlib@ folder.
