h1. Recipes Overview

Recipes are execution plans for installing, starting, orchestrating and monitoring your application stack without changing the application code or architecture.
Recipe ingredients includes:
* The recipe file written in domain specific language based on Groovy. The recipe file describes the following:
** the service name
** number of instances
** lifecycle events handling scripts or inline handling blocks
** monitoring configurations
** scaling and custom alert rules based on monitored metrics\\

* Additional Groovy or shell scripts that handle the different lifecycle events of the entire application and of each service
* Optionally- custom monitoring and life detection plugins for technologies that are not covered by built in plugins

h1. Basic Concepts

* Cloudify is built to onboard and manage <b>applications</b>.
* An <b>Application is a set of Services</b>, each <b>Service is a cluster of a an application tier</b> (e.g. cluster of Tomcats)
* Each Service is installed, managed and monitored by a <b>Service Recipe</b>.
* The <b>Application Recipe</b> sets the application name and the service inter-dependencies
* Future release will also support <b>provided services</b>(where the tier is only monitored for availability) by Cloudify
* The mandatory part of the recipe is the <b>life-cycle events</b> section - it maps events to scripts

h1. Lifecycle Events

Cloudify supports lifecycle events at 3 levels:
* Application level - these events are invoked typing commands in the Cloudify Shell
* Service level events - these are supported through the Service Recipe
* Service Instance level events - these are the most important ones. Also supported through the service recipe
* Service and Service instance custom events - are like built in life-cycle events but discussed separately.
