h2. Scaling services

Cloudify supports two methods of scaling a service:
# "Automatic Scaling":#sr1
# "Manual Scaling":#ms1


h2(#sr1). Automatic Scaling (Scaling Rules)

Cloudify enables each service to define one scaling rule for deciding if the service needs to scale out or shrink in. For example, a tomcat service can decide based on the average of busy threads, to increase the cluster size (i.e. the number of service instances) or to decrease it.

h4(info). In the current version, you can only describe one scaling rule per service.

h2. The Scaling Rule's Elements

* *Metrics* - Scaling rules are based on metrics defined by a recipe and are collected by the various java or groovy plugins from the application service.
The following are available:
** Any custom KPI (Key Performance Indicator)-  For example : JMX attributes
** Sampling rates - For example : the number of requests per second.
* *Statistic* - A scaling rule relates to a whole cluster that contains one or more instances of a service.
The following are available: 
** Avg/min/max/percentile
** Time range
* *Thresholds* - The rule has upper and lower thresholds. 
When the metric value is above the upper threshold, Cloudify increases the number of provisioned service instances.
When the metric value is below the lower threshold, Cloudify decreases the number of provisioned service instances.

h2(#ms1). Manual Scaling 

Cloudify also enables you to set the number of service instances manually.
In the following example, Cloudify will adjust the number of tomcat service instances to three.
If the tomcat service has *two* instances prior to invoking the following command, it will *increase* that number to three and if the tomcat service has *five* instances prior to invoking the following command, it will *decrease* that number to three.

*@set-instances tomcat 3@*

In order to enable manual scaling, you must set the *elastic* attribute to true in the service file.

Here's a snippet of a tomcat service file :
