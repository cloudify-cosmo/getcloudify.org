p. How to develop your custom Cloud Driver.

h1. How does the Cloud Driver Works – Technical introduction

Cloudify Cloud Driver (ProvisioningDriver is the Interface Name), has 4 main scenarios
# Bootstrap Cloud – which is the installation of Cloudify Management VM and Controller on a Cloud from your laptop
# Install Application – which is the creation of Application VMs with Cloudify Agent on them as part of an application deployment. In this case, the Cloud Driver resides on the management VM as part of Cloudify Controller
# Uninstall Application – termination of Application VMs.
# Teardown Cloud – Termination of all Cloudify VMs and components on the Cloud.

Another scenario: Cluster Healing is the same as Install Application from Cloud Driver perspective

The below sequence diagrams explains it in a more technical fashion.

h3. Flows explained

h4. Bootstrapping Cloud

In this scenario the Cloud Driver resides on the client side as no VM with Cloudify Server (Controller) exist.
The user instructs the Cloudify Interactive Shell to bootstrap Cloudify, providing a specific Cloud Driver implementation and configuration.
The Cloud Driver is instantiated by the shell and now the shell will need to give the Driver Reference to its configuration object
(org.cloudifysource.dsl.cloud.Cloud).  This is done by calling the setConfig method.

Next the Cloud Driver will be invoked by the shell using the startManagementMachines method.
This in turn will call the Cloud API using the API security settings in order to get the management VMs.

h1. The Cloud Driver Interface

The Cloud Driver Interface defines the methods for provisioning and installing the management virtual machines, the application virtual machines and getting Cloud information back.

* The {{setConfig}} method is called after the user invoked the {{bootstrap-cloud}} command from the Cloudify shell, loading the configuration file and preparing the Cloud Driver configuration {{Map}}
* The {{bootstrapCloud}} method succeeds the {{setConfig}} method; provisions the Cloudify management VM and installs the different Cloudify management services on that VM(s)
* The {{startMachine}} method called by the ESM when a new service needs to be installed, will provision a new VM and install the Clodify agent on this VM, returning the VM details
* The {{stopMachine}} method called by the ESM when a service needs to be shutdown or when a node needs to be moved to a larger machine etc, will shutdown and terminate the VM specified.
* The {{teardownCloud}} method will be shutting down and terminating any VM associated with the current Cloudify installation, once the user invoked the {{teardown-cloud}} from the Shell.

h1. The Cloud Driver Configuration DSL File

The Cloud Driver configuration file describes a particular configuration for the specific cloud vendor with several sub-sections:
* Configuration section that holds the management machine template name ans some other general configuration attributes
* Provider section describes the different attributes needed for the cloud driver to upload files from the shell to the cloud, accessing the management VMs etc.
* User section that describes the security credentials required for Cloudify to access the cloud API
* Templates section which is a map of VM template aliases mapped to their configurations. A template is a set of attributes the cloud driver needs to locate the suitable image to use and the machine HW to provision. Users reference the template aliases in the service recipe in order to get the required SW and HW from the cloud without addressing a specific Cloud API or terminology.
* Custom section is used by the developer of the cloud driver to add any set of custom attributes
