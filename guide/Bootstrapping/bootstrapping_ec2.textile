h1. Bootstrapping on EC2

In order to bootstrap Cloudify on EC2 you need an account on Amazon Web Services. Before you can use the shell to bootstrap your EC2 environment for the first time, please have the following:
1. Generate a private key and place the file (.pem) under &lt;Cloudify Root&gt;/tools/cli/plugins/esc/ec2/upload folder.
* In the "EC2 Console(Note that this link leads to US east key pairs menu)":https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/home?region=us-east-1#s=KeyPairs create a key pair and download the private key (.pem file).
* Click the Key Pairs under *Networking and Security* in the Navigation pane and then click the *Create Key Pair* button (call it myKeyPair-name and then save it as myKeyPair-name.pem) as shown here:

* This private key enables Cloudify cloud driver to create SSH connections to the newly created instances on EC2.

2. Edit ec2-cloud.groovy under &lt;Cloudify Root&gt;/tools/cli/plugins/esc/ec2/ and set the following:
* In the provider section, update the following attributes' values: 
 ** *cloudifyUrl* - Insert a full url path to the location of cloudify binaries (gigaspaces-cloudify.zip).
     If you have a private cloud, do the following:
 **# Download gigaspaces-cloudify.zip from FULL_URL_PATH_TO_gigaspaces-cloudify.zip
 **# Place the downloaded gigaspaces-cloudify.zip in your private cloud.
 **# Set the *cloudifyUrl* attribute to "FULL_URL_PATH_TO_gigaspaces-cloudify.zip_ON_YOUR_PRIVATE_CLOUD".
 ** *machineNamePrefix* - The value that you insert will be added as a name prefix to each one of your instances (not management instances).
 ** *managementOnlyFiles* - {color:red}TBD{color}.
 ** *managementGroup* - The value that you insert will be added as a name prefix to each one of your management instances.
 ** *zones* - {color:red}TBD{color}

* In the user section, update the following attributes' values: 
 ** *user* - Insert your EC2 Access Key ID.
You can get an active Access Key ID from the Access Credentials section in "EC2 Console(Link to the Access Credentials section in EC2 Console)":https://aws-portal.amazon.com/gp/aws/developer/account/index.html?action=access-key as shown here:
!GRA:Images2^EC2_ACCESS_KEY_AND_SECRET_KEY3.jpg!
 ** *apiKey* - Insert your EC2 Secret Access Key.
You can get a Secret Access Key from the "Access Credentials section in EC2 Console(Link to the Access Credentials section in EC2 Console)":https://aws-portal.amazon.com/gp/aws/developer/account/index.html?action=access-key as shown above.
{color:red}Note that the secret key must correspond to the above Access Key ID (that you set in the *user* attribute).{color} 
** *keyFile* - Insert the name of the private key file that you created (i.e.: myKeyPair-name.pem in our example).

* In the template section, update the following:  				 
 ** *locationId* - Insert the zone type from EC2 (e.g. : us-east-1 which stands for US East,Virginia).
 ** *imageId* - Insert the Amazon Machine type ID. 
     You can find the available types in "EC2 images types page":https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/home?region=us-east-1#s=Images as shown here:
!GRA:Images2^EC2_AMAZON_MACHINE_IMAGES2.JPG!
 ** *hardwareId* - Insert the Amazon API name of the desired hardware type.
     You can get it from "EC2 instance types page":http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types (e.g.: m1.small , c1.medium etc.) as shown here:

 ** *options* ("jclouds":http://www.jclouds.org/documentation) .
    *** *securityGroups* - Insert security group/s to determine whether network ports are opened or blocked on your instances.
    *** *keyPair* - Insert the name of the key pair that you created (whose content is in the .pem file in *keyFile* attribute in the user section).

Here's an example of ec2-cloud.groovy(with placeholders):
