p. Bootstrapping Cloudify on Windows Azure is quite simple and done from your computer using the Cloudify Interactive Shell 

h1. Starting the Interactive Shell

p. To start the Cloudify Inreractive Shell go to <Cloudify Home>/tools/cli and run cloudify.bat or cloudify.sh, if your running on Linux or Mac OS.

h1. Bootstrapping Windows Azure

p. Bootstrapping on Windows Azure is a process where Cloudify Cloud Driver on your machine interacts with Windows Azure management API to create a new Azure Deployment. Cloudify instrcuts Azure to do the following:
* Create a management worker role with Cloudify controller components
* Create a webui role with Cloudify Management Console webserver
* Create worker roles for each application service according to your recipe

Please note that currently, each application needs a seperate deployment on Windows Azure and therefore it will have a seperate Cloudify controller installation

The command to use is azure:bootstrap-application
