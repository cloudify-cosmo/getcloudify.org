h2. About this post

This post will give you a more thorough walkthru into the MongoDB recipe in the Pet Clinic Application recipe that we described in the "Quick Start Guide":/guide/qsg/quick_start_guide .


h2. What is Database Sharding?

Database Sharding can be simply defined as a "shared-nothing" partitioning scheme for large databases across a number of servers, enabling new levels of database performance and scalability achievable. 
Another way of "looking" at it, is : 
Breaking your database down into smaller chunks called "shards" and spreading those shards across a number of distributed servers.


h2. MongoDB Sharding

MongoDB supports an automated sharding/partitioning architecture, enabling horizontal scaling across multiple nodes. 

A MongoDB shard cluster consists of two or more shards, one or more configuration servers, and any number of routing processes to which the application servers connect. 

Each shard consists of one or more servers and stores data using mongod processes (mongod is the core MongoDB database process).
In a production environment, each shard will consist of multiple servers to ensure availability and automated failover. 


h2. About the Pet Clinic Application

The Pet Clinic Application presented in the Quick Start Guide is a port to Grails of the standard "Java based Spring framework PetClinic sample app":http://static.springsource.org/docs/petclinic.html.
It uses MongoDB instead of MySql as the backend store, and leverages the Grails GORM bindings to MongoDB. The users of the application are employees of the clinic who need to view and manage information regarding veterinarians, pet owners, and their pets.
The Application's production environment is based on a 2-tier architecture:
# Web and Business Logic Tier - Composed of the Grails application deployed on Apache Tomcat.
# The Data Tier - Composed of "a sharded MongoDB cluster(Sharded MongoDB)":http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Sharding+Introduction, which is composed of the following components:
## "Configuration Server(MongoDB Configuration Server)":http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Configuring+Sharding#ConfiguringSharding-ConfigServers : Stores the cluster's metadata, which includes basic information on each shard server and the chunks contained therein.
## Routing Processes (mongos): A routing and coordination process that mediates between client requests and the actual mongod instances.  When receiving client requests, the mongos process routes the request to the appropriate mongod instance(s) and merges any results sent back to the client.
## Mongod instances (AKA shards): In our case, there are two instances of mongod to store the application data.

Obviously, the amount of instances for each of the above components can be easily changed, by modifying the numInstances attribute of the relevant Cloudify recipe file (i.e: &lt;service-name&gt;-service.groovy).

*Note*: When you install MongoDB on Windows 7, you need to make sure that you run as an administrator. See "Installing MongoDB on Windows 7":http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Windows+Service.


h2. Our Pet Clinic Topology

As mentioned above, in our recipe we use: two shards (Mongod), one configuration server (MongoConfig), one routing server (MongoS) and one Tomcat.
Here's our Pet Clinic Application's Topology:

h2. Our Pet Clinic Recipe Anatomy

The following diagram depicts the application recipe file and folder structure:

h2. Mongo services in the Pet Clinic Recipe

Let's take a closer look at the Mongo entities in the PetClinic application recipe.
# The Shards (mongod) recipe folder
# The Configuration Server (mongoConfig) recipe folder
# The Routing Processes (mongos) recipe folder

In each of the above folders you will find all the files required to run the corresponding service. 
A "service" in this context is an application tier - e.g. web container, database, etc.


h2. The Mongo Config Server (mongoConfig) Service Recipe

The Mongo Config Server (mongoConfig) Server recipe does the following:
* Calculates its port according to its instance ID and properties file and notifies the serviceContext, so that the other services will be able to access it.
* Downloads, unzips and installs the mongo binaries on the VM.
* Starts the Configuration Server process.
* Detects a successful startup using the MongoLivenessDetector plugin.
* Looks for metrics (Active Read Clients, Active Write Client etc.) to be displayed in the Web UI.

The mongo-config service file is located at &lt;cloudify root&gt;/examples/petclinic/mongoConfig/mongoConfig-service.groovy. 

h2. The Mongo Sharding Server (mongos) Recipe 

The Mongo Router (mongos) recipe does the following:
* Calculates its port according to its instance ID and properties file and notifies the serviceContext, so that the other services will be able to access it.
* Downloads, unzips and installs the mongo binaries on the VM.
* Starts the Router Server process.
* Detects a successful startup using the MongoLivenessDetector plugin.
* Looks for host address and port of the mongoConfig service (using the serviceContext API) and the the Mongo data shards (mongod), and configures sharding.
* Looks for metrics (Active Read Clients, Active Write Client etc.) to be displayed in the Web UI.

The mongos service file is located at &lt;cloudify root&gt;/examples/petclinic/mongos/mongos-service.groovy.

h2. The Mongo Data Shards (mongod) Recipe

The Mongo Data Shards (mongod) Recipe does the following:
* Calculates its port according to its instance ID and properties file and notifies the serviceContext, so that the other services will be able to access it.
* Downloads, unzips and installs the mongo binaries on the VM
* Starts the Shard Server process.
* Detects a successful startup using the MongoLivenessDetector plugin
* Looks for metrics (Active Read Clients, Active Write Client etc.) to be displayed in the Web UI.

The mongod service file is located at &lt;cloudify root&gt;/examples/petclinic/mongod/mongod-service.groovy.


Here's the relevant code snippets that show how we expose the mongos service instance (host and port) to the tomcat service instance.
For that purpose, we use our powerful ServiceContext API and its k/v store mechanism.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/1698917.js?file=exposeMongosService.groovy"></script>
  
And then we retrieve the data in &lt;cloudify root&gt;/examples/petclinic/tomcat/tomcat_start.groovy

<script src="https://gist.github.com/1698923.js?file=retrieveMongosServie.groovy"></script>

From this point, the tomcat service instance knows the host address and port of the mongos service instance.
