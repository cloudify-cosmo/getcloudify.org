h2. Before You Install

h3. Prerequisites for Installing the Cloudify Interactive Shell Client 

* JDK 1.6 must be installed:
** "(newwindow)JDK 1.6":http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp - download the latest update (for example, JDK 6 Update 23).
* You must set the JAVA_HOME environment variable, and make sure it points to the correct JDK (not JRE) directory prior to installing Cloudify. For example, D:\Java\jdk1.6.0_23.
* The JAVA_HOME/bin directory should be added to the beginning of the Path environment variable. For example, %JAVA_HOME%\bin;SystemRoot%\system32;%SystemRoot%;%SystemRoot%
 * There's no need to set the PATH if JAVA_HOME is set.

h3. Prerequisites for Cloud Images that Are Used By Cloudify

When installing applications on the cloud, Cloudify provision virtual machines for you. It is assumed by Cloudify that these virtual machines: 
* Have JDK 1.6 or higher included in the image. 
* SSH daemon started and running port 22.


h2. Networking and Ports on the Cloud

Cloudify assumes the following with regrads to networking: 
* Within the security group to which the started images belong, all ports are are open for bidirectional communication via private IPs.
* Ports 8099 and 8100 on the management VMs are open for communication from the outside via the VMs' public IP, so that the Cloudify interactive shell client can interact with the REST gateway and users can access the management web application.
