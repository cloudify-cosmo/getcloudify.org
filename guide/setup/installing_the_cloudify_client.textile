h2. Configuring Command Prompt (Windows)

Command Prompt has a known issue of freezing when reaching the maximum number of characters allowed in a row. Therefore, we recommend that you configure the *Screen Buffer Size* and the *Window Size* for the command prompt before you run the Cloudify shell.

h3. To configure Command Prompt

# Right-click on the title bar of the *Command Prompt* window, and then click *Properties*.
