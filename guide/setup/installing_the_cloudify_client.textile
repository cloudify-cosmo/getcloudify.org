This topic provides step-by-step instructions for installing the Cloudify interactive shell client.

h1. Prerequisites

Before you install the Cloudify interactive shell client, make sure that your environment meets all the minimum requirements. For more information, see "Cloudify Prerequisites":/guide/setup/cloudify_prerequisites.

# Install @java@ on your machine

h1. Configuring the Command Prompt window (Microsoft Windows)

The shell has a known issue of freezing when reaching the maximum number of characters allowed in a row. Therefore, we recommend that you configure the *Screen Buffer Size* and *Window Size* for the *Command Prompt* window in which the Cloudify shell is running.

h2. To configure the Command Prompt window

# Right-click on the title bar of the *Command Prompt* window, and then click *Properties*.
