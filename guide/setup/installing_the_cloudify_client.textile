This topic provides step-by-step instructions for installing the Cloudify interactive shell client.

h1. Prerequisites

Before you install the Cloudify interactive shell client, make sure that your environment meets all the minimum requirements. For more information, see "Cloudify Prerequisites":/guide/setup/cloudify_prerequisites.

h1. Configuring the shell window buffer size (on Windows)

The shell has a known issue of freezing when reaching the maximum number of characters allowed in a row. Therefore, we recommend that you configure the *Screen Buffer Size* and *Window Size* for the command prompt window in which the Cloudify shell is running.

h2. To configure the command prompt window

# Right-click on the title bar of the command prompt window, and then click *Properties*.

# On the *Layout* tab, under *Screen Buffer Size* and *Window Size* sections, specify the desired *Width* and *Height* sizes, and then click *OK*.
