When designing recipes, we recommend that you create *environment agnostic* service descriptor files so that the recipe can run in different environment. This is easily achieved using a Groovy *properties* file to define keys that you can use as parameters in your service descriptor file.

The properties file must be saved in the same folder as the service descriptor file, and we recommend using the following naming convention: @<myRecipe>-service.properties@ (e.g. jboss-service.properties). The keys are defined using a simple @Key=Value@ notation (e.g. @myKey=myValue@) and can be used in DSL closures as string parameters. They can also be used in other strings using the @${Key}@ notation (e.g. @${myKey}@).

The following shows an example properties file and a section of its corresponding service descriptor file that uses the defined keys as parameters.
