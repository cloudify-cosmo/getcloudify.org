h1. Bootstrapping The Bring You Own Node (BYON) Host Pool

h2. BYON Overview

The BYON Cloud Driver is an impelementation of the Cloudify Cloud Driver allowing a user to use a set of physical machines or virtual machines
as one or more pools for application virtualizations.
Typical use case for such a scenario can be development and QA Labs.

The BYON works very similar to other Cloud Drivers. It defines templates that have aliases that can be referenced by the different
recipes. Each template is a pool of machines that can be defined by specifying each IP, IP range or even a CIDR mask.

When the BYON driver is asked to bootstrap the pool it simply access one machine in the template specified for the management
machine and using SSH it installs the Cloudify management components on it.

When the BYON driver is requested by Cloudify controller to provision machines for application installation, it will install and start Cloudify agent 
on availabel machine using the temaplates names specified in the service recipes.

In that sense you can allocate different HW and SW stack to different services, exactly the same way as running a recipe on a cloud

h2. BYON Prerequisites 

Please note that Cloudify expects Java JDK and SSH to be installed on the machines in the pools. 
Please check the "Prerequisites page":/guide/bootstrapping/bootstrapping_byon for more information.
