p. Cloudify recipes are like object oriented classes. they can be extended, inheriting the parent recipe functionality

h1. Extending a recipe
To start the Cloudify Inreractive Shell go to <Cloudify Home>/tools/cli and run cloudify.bat or cloudify.sh, if your running on Linux or Mac OS.

Cloudify allows to extend and override parts of recipes.
If you are familiar with OOP, this is similar to inheritance. In the following example the travel-tomcat service extends the tomcat service
<pre>
service {
    name "travel-tomcat"
	extend "../../../recipes/tomcat"

}
</pre>
You may add different scripts in the extended recipe folder to override the original life-cycle scripts.
